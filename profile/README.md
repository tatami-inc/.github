# Matrix representations in C++

## About

No, we're not really a corporation, I just couldn't get the **@tatami** or **@tatami-galaxy** handles because they were already taken.

**tatami**  is a C++ library that provides a variety of matrix representations through a common interface.
Developers can code against this interface to create applications that can support many different representations.
This includes:

- Dense row/column major matrices, with user-defined storage modes and containers.
- Compressed sparse row/column matrices, with user-defined storage modes and containers.
- Matrices generated by delayed operations, ~stolen~ inspired by those in [**DelayedArray**](https://github.com/Bioconductor/DelayedArray).
- Matrices backed by HDF5 files, either as dense datasets or in a compressed sparse format.
- Wrappers around R matrices that cannot be transformed into the above types, for use within R packages.

Check out the [core library](https://github.com/tatami-inc/tatami) for more details.
