# Matrix representations in C++

## About

No, we're not really a corporation, I just couldn't get the **@tatami** or **@tatami-galaxy** handles because they were already taken.

**tatami**  is a C++ library that provides a variety of matrix representations through a common interface.
Developers can code against this interface to create applications that can support many different representations.
This includes:

- Dense row/column major matrices, with user-defined storage modes and containers.
- Compressed sparse row/column matrices, with user-defined storage modes and containers.
- Matrices generated by delayed operations, ~stolen~ inspired by those in [**DelayedArray**](https://github.com/Bioconductor/DelayedArray).
- Matrices backed by HDF5 files, either as dense datasets or in a compressed sparse format.
- Matrices backed by dense or sparse TileDB arrays.
- Wrappers around R matrices that cannot be transformed into the above types, for use within R packages.

## Getting started

### Using C++ 

**tatami** is implemented as a header-only C++ library and can be dropped directly into an existing project.
Check out the [core repository](https://github.com/tatami-inc/tatami) for more details;
this provides the interface as well as many of the in-memory representations and delayed operations.

**tatami** extensions provide more matrix representations and can be included on an as-needed basis.
As these often depend on additional third-party libraries, they are not included as part of the core **tatami** library. 

- [**tatami_hdf5**](https://github.com/tatami-inc/tatami_hdf5) provides representations for HDF5-backed matrices.
- [**tatami_tiledb**](https://github.com/tatami-inc/tatami_tiledb) provides representations for TileDB-backed matrices.
- [**tatami_r**](https://github.com/tatami-inc/tatami_r) provides representations for unknown R matrices.

### Using R

The [**beachmat**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/beachmat) Bioconductor package vendors the **tatami** library,
allowing R package developers to compile their C++ code against the **tatami** interface.
It also implements the `initializeCpp()` generic that maps an abstract R matrix to a suitable C++ representation for immediate use by package code.

**beachmat** also provides several extensions that mirror those of **tatami**.
These can be included by package developers or users on an as-needed basis.

- [**beachmat.hdf5**](https://github.com/tatami-inc/beachmat.hdf5) vendors **tatami_hdf5** and implements `initializeCpp()` methods for [**HDF5Array**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/HDF5Array) classes.
